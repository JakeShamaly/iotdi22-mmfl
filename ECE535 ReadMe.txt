Federated Learning Project
Motivation: To learn more about Federated Learning.
Design Goals: 
Understand and benchmark different multimodal datasets in a federated setting.
Deliverables: 
Understand multimodal federated learning
Use given datasets to reproduce the results in the paper
Perform a per-class accuracy analysis of the results and observe the effect of skewed data distribution on the per-class accuracy
Evaluate the system on a multimodal dataset that is relatively balanced in class distribution
System Blocks:
        Will be documented here as we progress through the project.
Software/Hardware:
        Python 3.7+, Laptop with CUDA-enabled GPU (optional), Anaconda 3, Pytorch 1.8+, Torchvision 0.9+, Numpy 1.19+, Matplotlib 3.3+, Scipy 1.4+, MPI for Python 3.0+
Project Timeline: 
        *NOTE: This is an estimate of how we plan to budget our time on the project, so this may change as time goes on and we get more information*
        By October: Have a good grasp on the concepts of the project and what is expected of us. Know what we have to do with the code and be ready to start, if not already started with replicating the results.
        By November: Have the results closely if not entirely replicated, and have only the write-up and report portions of the project left
        By December: Be nearly, if not completely done, and only need to clean up loose ends
