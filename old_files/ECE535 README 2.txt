These are old files that were generated in past iterations of our code. Explanations for each of the items in this folder has been provided below.

opp folder: These are old opp files that were generated before we started tracking per-class accuracy. As such, their data is valid, but just doesn't report the per-class accuracy as requested by the project.

pdf files: These graph images were generated using the results in the opp folder described above. In essence, we use the single_multi_modality_comparison() and cross_modality_comparison() methods to do this, and these methods still work the same as they did when these graphs were generated.

opp.mat: This is a .mat file that we generated ourselves using the instructions provided by the original GitHub repository. However, per the project instructions we were told to use the .mat files provided by Prof. Anwar. Thus, this file is irrelevant save for the fact that it shows we were able to generate it in the first place. Note that this may or may not be included in the Git repository, as GitHub prevents us from pushing if the files are too large (.mat files tend to be quite beefy).
